  "html": "<p>Tweed is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is built on the idea of\nloose coupling of the components that comprise your UI.</p>\n<p>This tour will introduce you to the library, show you how to create interactive components\nand how to think about data and state in your components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"optional-types\">Optional Types</h3>\n<p>Tweed is written in JavaScript that includes features of the language that are proposed,\nbut not actually yet standardized. It also uses a syntax called JSX, which adds an\nXML-like syntax to JavaScript, making it easy to move to Virtual DOM from writing common\nHTML.</p>\n<p>All these features, <em>are</em> available in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org\" title=\"TypeScript Homepage\">TypeScript</a>, though. TypeScript also\nadds the ability to declare static typing in the code. Even though Tweed itself is written\nin JavaScript compiled by <a href=\"http://babeljs.io\" title=\"Babel Homepage\">Babel</a>, it also comes prepackaged with external type\ndeclarations, so that TypeScript support is available out-of-the-box. Furthermore, it is\neasy to decide whether to install Babel or TypeScript specific tooling if you use the\nTweed CLI.</p>\n<p>Whatever your preference is, all the examples on this website will be available in both\nwith and without static types.</p>\n",
